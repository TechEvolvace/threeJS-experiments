# Experiment 1
In the first experiment, I aim to develop an app with a specific 3D interface using ThreeJS. 

## Current Progress
Currently, this app successfully displays a rotating yellow 3D cube using ThreeJS. Now, I'll aim to develop a 3D interface, with its design and functionality matching as specified in relevant issues in GitHub, for this app to complete Experiment 1 successfully!
